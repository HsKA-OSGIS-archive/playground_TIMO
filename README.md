The application is a tourist application that helps Tourist easily locate some basic emenitiies they may need.The data for the Backend was gotten from OpenStreetmap(OSM) and the back end was done using PostgreSQL. The application was created mainly with Javasctipt but HTML and Css was also used to design the frontend. We also tried to make it a Progressive Web application (PWA). This would make it easier for the web app to still be usable even without Internet service.  To achieve this we had made use of a Manifest.jaon, service worker and these had to linked to the html file for the PWA to become active.
